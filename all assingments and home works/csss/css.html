      India is a land of various cultures and a rich heritage. It is the
      seventh-largest country by area and the second-most populous country
      globally. The peacock is India’s national bird, and the Bengal tiger is
      the country’s national animal. The national song is named Vande Matram
      (written by Bankimchandra Chatterji). The Indian national song was first
      performed at the Indian National Congress in 1896. ‘Jana Gana Mana,’
      India’s national anthem, is sung in 52 seconds. The national flag of India
      is named Tiranga, which is made up of three colours: saffron, white, and
      green, with the Ashoka Chakra in navy blue in the centre.
